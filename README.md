# 🩺 Depression Support Medical System  

A web-based medical system designed to support patients who may be experiencing depression.  
The platform enables patients, counselors, doctors, and managers to interact through a secure and user-friendly system.  
This project was originally developed in **2023** using **HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL** and later uploaded to GitHub in **2025** for portfolio purposes.

## 📌 Overview  
This project was developed as part of a software engineering course project.  
Its objective is to design a platform where:  
- Patients can register, take a self-assessment test, and get medical help.  
- Counselors and doctors can review results, manage patient records, and set appointments.  
- Managers can oversee system activity, assign patients, and generate reports.  

The system followed an **Agile development approach** with iterative sprints and focuses on building a **middle-fidelity prototype** that can serve as the basis for a real product.
